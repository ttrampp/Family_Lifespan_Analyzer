# Overview
Project: Family Lifespan Analyzer
Author: Tanya Trampp

The goal of this project was to build a small but functional Kotlin console program that analyzes family lifespan data.
This project demonstrates my ability to use Kotlin syntax, data classes, enumerations, and basic logic to calculate how 
long a person has lived-- or is still living-- based on input data.

As a software engineer in training, I wanted to strengthen my understanding of how Kotlin handles data modeling, null
safety, and simple arithmetic operations. This program gae me hands-on practice with real Kotlin concepts instead of
just reading about them.

# Development Environment

This project was developed using **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** with the **Kotlin/JVM** setup.
I used **OpenJDK 25.0.1** as my runtime environment.

Language and Libraries:
--Programming Language: **Kotlin**
--No external libraries were required -- only the standard library.
--The program uses Kotlin features such as `enum class`, `data class`, nullable types, and standard functions such as `println()`.

# Future Work

List of Future Improvement Plans:

- Add user input validation and error handling.
- Create a small file import option (CSV or JSON) to load family data automatically.
- Add color formatting and spacing to improve console readability.
